# Clipboard App ✂️📋

This is a clipboard manager app built using **Tauri**, **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Rust**.

## Why this app?

macOS does not come with built-in clipboard history functionality like Windows (e.g. `Win + V`). That’s why I created this simple app to keep a local clipboard history.

While building this, I'm also exploring and learning how Rust works (although I still don’t fully understand it yet 😅: skill issue). This app is part of my journey to understand system-level programming and native app development using Rust and Tauri.
